# Page-Table-Sim
Simulates a page table management program, and processes virtual memory addresses into physical addresses based on given parameters such as page table size.

Basic Usage: PTESim <BytesPerPage> <SizeOfVirtualMemory> <SizeOfPhysicalMemory> <SequenceFile> <outputfile>.

Test sequences were used with a system with 1K physical memory, 4K virtual memory, and 128 bytes per page and frame.
